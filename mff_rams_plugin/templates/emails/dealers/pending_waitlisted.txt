I regret to inform you that you have been placed on the waiting list for dealer space at this year's {{ c.EVENT_NAME}}. 
Please be assured that your placement on the waiting list in no way reflects a rejection of your suitability to deal at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. The simple truth is that I received many more applications than I have available tables, and had to make some difficult decisions. If tables later become available, you will be notified.

In the event that being waitlisted will cause you to want to withdraw from the {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} hotel room lottery, please fill out the form here: https://jira.furfest.org/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/create/43

Please create an account if you do not already have one and include your confirmation number for fastest service.
