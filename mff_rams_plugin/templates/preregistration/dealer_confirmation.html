    We've received your application for {{ group.name }} to purchase a Dealer registration for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.

    <br/><br/>
    {% if c.AFTER_DEALER_REG_DEADLINE %}
        Since the Dealers Room is currently full, you've been added to our waitlist, and we'll let you know if a spot opens up for you.
    {% else %}
        We receive a flood of applications every year, so application processing takes a considerable amount of time.
        Approvals will be done as promptly as possible; usually within <strong>three to four weeks</strong> of when the initial application period closes.

    <h3>What Happens Next</h3>
    After approval, you will be emailed a link to manage your dealer registration. From this link, you will be able to:
    <ul>
        <li>Pay for your dealer registration, which includes the cost of tables and badges.</li>
        <li>Register your Dealer Assistants.</li>
        <li>After your badge and table payment is received, you may add and pay for additional Dealer Assistants.</li>
    </ul>

    Your Dealership Payment includes your table cost and all badges in your group.  After payment, you'll be sent a link
    by email to follow if you wish to later upgrade your badge. Your Dealer Assistants will be able to upgrade their own
    badges and pay for those upgrades on their own.

    <br/><br/>Approximately two to three weeks before the convention you will be sent an email with specifics on loading instructions and other information.

    <br/><br/>If your application is not approved you will be sent an email with information on our Waiting List policies.
