    Suite entries are processed first and prioritized above standard room entries in the lottery. Suites are in extremely high demand, and necessitate special policies:
    <ul>
        <li>A one night, non-refundable deposit is required and will be invoiced on confirmation of the suite.</li>
        <li>Cancellations must be received on or prior to {{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_SUITE_CUTOFF|datetime_local }}, otherwise all guests in that suite will be ineligible for future year suite lotteries in addition to forfeiting the deposit.</li>
        <li>All suites are directly managed by {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Suite confirmations are issued by the convention, not the hotel.</li>
        <li>Additional policies apply to suites. It is essential all attendees requesting a suite read and understand these policies, as you are required to comply as a condition of retaining the suite during the event, and for eligibility in future years.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>If awarded a suite, you will receive additional information via email regarding your suite.</p>

<p>Suite policies, floor plans and other details pertaining to suites may be found on the <a href="https://www.furfest.org/attend/hotels/suites" target="_blank">Suite FAQ</a>.</p>
