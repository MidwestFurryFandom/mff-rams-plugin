<p>
    The {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} room lottery is open and applicable to all available room types at all {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} partner hotels, including suites, ADA rooms, and standard rooms.
    <strong>These rooms are only available through the lottery</strong>, and any unclaimed/cancelled rooms will be made available subsequently via booking links on <a href="http://furfest.org/" target="_blank">furfest.org</a> as they become available.
    To ensure a safe and secure booking process, please <strong>ONLY</strong> book through these official channels -- third parties claiming to have rooms may not be looking out for your best interests!
</p>
<p>
    If this is your first time entering the room lottery or you just need a refresher on how things work, please review the following:
    <ul>
        <li>The lottery is only open to registered attendees and dealers.</li>
        <li>Only one room entry and one suite entry is allowed per attendee. Entries may be changed, modified, or withdrawn while the lottery is open.</li>
        <li>Attendees wishing to enter as a group should designate a "group leader" to complete a single room and/or suite entry. They can then invite others to join their group as group members.</li>
        <li>You will be able to rank your hotel choice, the type of room, and your check-in and check-out dates in order of preference.</li>
        <li>Results will take approximately seven business days after the lottery closes.</li>
        <li>Suites require a one night non-refundable deposit.</li>
        <li>All partner hotels require that the primary guest is at least 21 years of age. Attendees under 21 may enter a room group, but will not be able to complete a lottery entry for themselves.</li>
    </ul>

    Your information from <a href="../preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}" target="_blank">your registration</a> will be used in the hotel lottery in the following ways:
    <ul>
        <li>Your current email address (<strong>{{ attendee.email }}</strong>) will be used for all hotel lottery notifications.</li>
        <li>If you are a room group leader, your group members will be required to enter your email address along with the group invite code to join your group, so you will need to share this email with them.</li>
        <li>If you request an ADA room, our accessibility team will be sent your request details, first and last name (<strong>{{ attendee.full_name }}</strong>), and email address in order to contact you.</li>
        <li>
            When reservations are built for lottery awards, your registration contact information will be used, including legal name, phone number, email, and mailing address.
            <ul>
            <li>Hotels require your legal first and last name to match the photo ID you use during check-in. If the first and last name on your photo ID is not {{ attendee.legal_first_name }} {{ attendee.legal_last_name }}, please contact us at {{ c.REGDESK_EMAIL|email_only|email_to_link }} to change it <strong>before the lottery closes</strong>.</li>
            <li>If you need to update either your email or name after the lottery closes, please contact us at {{ c.HOTELS_EMAIL|email_only|email_to_link }}.</li>
